     <h2>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
     <p>Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet
       i.e. websites.</p>

     <h2>App-DEVELOPMENT</h2>
     <br>
     <p>Forbes is right on the money. Mobile is indeed the future of everything, from business and healthcare app development to gaming and all-things good in between. And industry by industry insights and overall usage numbers agree.
       Mobile app development refers to the process of writing software that works on a mobile device (smartphones, tables, wearable). But app development is not only about coding a native, HTML5 or hybrid app. It is about the strategic process of defining, designing, building and launching a successful mobile product.

In this article, based on our experience in building mobile apps for over ten years, you will learn everything we know about mobile app development.

We take you through every step of building a great mobile product: from ideation to market validation, persona definition to creating beautiful designs, creating a robust development architecture and writing clean code, followed by how you build a marketing plan to hit the ground running the day your app is published on the App Store.

But most importantly, read this article to learn from the mistakes of many app builders, investors and entrepreneurs. Building a great app isn’t cheap. We’ve seen people waste millions, literally, on building bad products or launching poorly designed apps. Don’t be that person.

Take the time to read this article, beginning to end, to make sure you build the best possible app that will do justice to your amazing idea..</p>

<h2>Coding-LANGUAGES</h2>
<br>
<p>The Master of Science in Computer Science Align program at Northeastern University is specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another field of study.

“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come out as software engineers,” says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer science programs
 at Northeastern University—Seattle. “We focus on math, programming, and a variety of computer science and engineering concepts.

   <h2>BASKETBALL </h2>
   <br>
   <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)
     through
     the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points,
     unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most
     points
     at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>

       <h2>HUSBANDRY/AGRICULTURE</h2>
       <p>Agriculture is by far the most comprehensive of these terms; in common with farming and husbandry it implies the cultivation of the soil, the production and harvesting of crops, the care and breeding of livestock; it includes in addition other pursuits that may or may not be connected with farming and husbandry such as horticulture, forestry, dairying, sugar making, and beekeeping.

The number of people employed in agriculture has fallen in the last decade.
It often stresses the technological as contrasted with the traditional aspects of such activities and may include in varying degrees the preparation of agricultural products for man's use.

The Ukraine is strong both in industry and agriculture.
Husbandry usually suggests small holdings and production for the use of a household or community rather than for a distant market.

They depended on animal husbandry for their livelihood.
Animal husbandry on the grassland is developing rapidly.
It often suggests more varied employments than farming (as dairying or beekeeping) and often denotes management of a particular branch of farming.
