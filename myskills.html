       <h3>MANIPULATION</h3>
       <p>Manipulation is the exercise of harmful influence over others. People who manipulate others attack their mental and emotional sides to get what they want. The person manipulating — called the manipulator — seeks to create an imbalance of
         power, and take advantage of a victim to get power, control, benefits, and/or privileges at the expense of the victim.

         Manipulation can happen in close or casual relationships, but they are more common in closely formed relationships. In a way, everyone can manipulate others to get what they want. But manipulation is defined as any attempt to sway someone’s
         emotions to get them to act or feel a certain way.<br>

         Manipulators have common tricks they’ll use to make you feel irrational and more likely to give in to their requests. A few common examples include:

         ● Guilt <br>

         ● Complaining <br>

         ● Comparing <br>

         ● Lying <br>

         ● Denying <br>

         ● Feigning ignorance or innocence <br>

         ● Blame <br>

         ● Mind games <br> </p>

       <h3>BASKETBALL </h3>
       <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through
         the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points,
         unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points
         at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>

       <h3>SMOKING WEED #すべての</h3>
       <p>It’s unclear how long humans have used Marijuana as a drug, but archaeologists have discovered tools used to burn Psychoactive Marijuana dating back 2,500 years in China. The Chinese Emperor Shen Nung created the first written record of
         Marijuana use in the year 2727 BC, almost 5,000 years ago. Because of the speed of its growth and the use of hemp for rope and cloth, Marijuana saw use throughout many ancient societies lasting through to the present day. Even though humans
         have been smoking Marijuana for thousands of years, its effects on the body are still being discovered. As it becomes more legal and more available, knowing those effects has become more important.</p>
